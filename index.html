        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F </p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>Place chocolate and butter in the top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes.
         
         
         </p>
 <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>Combine eggs and sugar in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until pale and thick, about 5 minutes. Mix in melted chocolate, cocoa powder, and flour until combined. Pour batter into the prepared ramekins and place on a baking tray. </p>
 <p><strong> Step 4:</strong>Bake in the preheated oven until the sides are set but the middle is still jiggly, 10 to 13 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
